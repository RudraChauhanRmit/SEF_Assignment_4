# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  java-test: # Job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner.  
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # The uses keyword specifies that this step will run v4 of the actions/checkout action. 
        # This is an action that checks out your repository onto the runner,
        #  allowing you to run scripts or other actions against your code (such as build and test tools). 
        # You should use the checkout action any time your workflow will use the repository's code.
